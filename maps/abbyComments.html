<h2>Quick Strategy</h2>
<p>Abbey is a smaller map that is decided very quickly which team will have the upper hand.  This map has 3 key locations located in the center of the map that are crucial to obtaining map control. Taking the west side is usually key to winning, since you can then defend the Abbey proper from the ridge across the lake.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>There's not a lot of scouting opportunities in the early stages.  Hold back until one of the 3 lanes to the enemy camp is clear, then go searching for hidden Artys and and TD's.</p>
<h3>Heavies and Mediums</h3>
<p>Divide up between the east, middle and west lanes.</p>
<h3>Destroyers</h3>
<p>Assist along the east and west lanes. Both camps offer a few sniper positions to defend the camp if the enemy breaks through any of the 3 lanes.</p>
<p>H9: Getting on top of this ridge is a little difficult, but offers a good sniping position for enemy at F5/G5 and F8.  If red breaks through the east lane, best get out fast.</p>
<h3>SPG</h3>
<p>There are several descent positions along the back along the north and south borders to offer support fire.</p>
<h3>Dangers</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A large abbey and town fill the center of the map with three roads allowing passage from the north and south, and includes an elevated firing position in the abbey's courtyard at the highest point on the hill. West of the town is an elongated hill with several positions allowing fire down into the town. Further west and past the hill, a valley offers significant protection against artillery fire. East of the town lies a curved cliff road which affords shielding from most tank and artillery fire, but forces attackers to travel in a single path.</p>
