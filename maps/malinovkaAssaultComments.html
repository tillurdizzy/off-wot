<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Initial staging areas are separated by a wide open field, ideal for artillery and defensive operations. Make use of flanking maneuvers and natural defenses like woods, hills, and farmhouses, as these can be decisive. Another option is a well-coordinated high-speed combined arms attack across the field which could bring victory, but at the risk of a bloody loss. Colloquially also known as "Campinovka" for the tendency of most players to just sit behind cover on their side of the starting field and snipe each other. </p>
