<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A flat hilltop in the center of this map provides an excellent firing position, but the short drive from either starting position makes climbing the hill a dangerous endeavor. Nestled in the canyon northeast of the hill is the small village of Pagorki; offering a tempting route with plenty of cover, but one that is exposed if the enemy controls the hill. West of the hill, surrounded by shallow water, is a small island which offers good cover while providing a large fire zone. While the island is protected from the hill, it is, for the most part, vulnerable to flanking attacks or fire from multiple angles. The island cover is solid, but not particularly large. </p>
