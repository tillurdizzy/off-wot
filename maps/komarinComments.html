<h2>Quick Strategy</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Mediums and Lights</h3>
<p>Advance down the 1-2 line on spawn one or the 8-9 line on spawn two.</p>
<h3>Destroyers</h3>
<p>TD's camp out in A1-E2 for spawn one or F9-K0 for spawn two.</p>
<h3>Heavies</h3>
<p>Heavies should secure the middle.  The middle provides good support fire and spotting, although the tanks are at major risk.  But once cleared out, tanks with good camo, fire, and view range can provide a major advantage to the rest of the mapâ€¦however, its nearly impossible to leave the middle once you are there, as moving down the middle is horribly exposed.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A more or less unique map in that the teams do not start near the flags, Komarin offers multiple tactical options. The teams start in the north and south, divided by rivers offering three routes. The rivers itself are mostly impassable. The middle bridge is also only accessible once a heavy tank clears the obstacles by driving over them or if someone clears them with HE ammo. The center route is a large, elevated, and wooded island connected by bridge to the south, and offers firing positions to nearly the entire map, but at the cost of being exposed if spotted. A small village on both the west and east side of the map offer attackers valuable cover en route to the flag, but leave any tank passing the village exposed to covered and concealed defenders once they leave the village.</p>
