<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>C5: There's a small ridge and a good bush for cover here.  Best used for late in the game.</p>
<h3>Mediums</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Destroyers</h3>
<p>Spread out along the ridgelines to defend against any rushes through the middle and counter-snipe.</p>
<h3>Heavies</h3>
<p>Heavily armored tanks should head north or west (depending on the spawn) towards the A1 corner. Traditionally, the northern flank takes a more defensive approach and allows the southern flank to cross the valley and advance partially up into A2.</p>
<h3>SPG</h3>
<p>Primarily focus at the A2 corner, though this may be difficult for SPGs with poor gun arcs to hit targets behind cliffs. However, SPGs should also take advantage of any spotted snipers on the ridges.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A large valley filled with rocks, vegetation, and a small village surrounding a dried out river bed separate the two teams. The large hills on either side of the valley offer many firing positions, and very little cover in the valley will protect a large tank completely against all positions. Regardless of approach, attackers will face a long climb into the enemy's camp, and effective use of the cover en route is essential. The northern approach offers plentiful protection to attack either hill, but the southern approach makes up for lack of protection with shorter distances and better concealment.</p>
