<h2>Quick Strategy</h2>
<p>Hot spots on East and West lanes. Red has the advantage moving south on the East side.  Mediums and TD's can lend support to the lanes from the middle.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>Move quickly up the inside lanes to get some first spots for artillary and let the heavies know what is coming.  Then get the heck out once the fighting starts.  Move toward the middle to support the flanking positions.</p>
<h3>Mediums</h3>
<p>Follow behind to support the heavies in the hot spots, or take up a flanking position in the middle.</p>
<p>F2 and D2: This slight depression can offer some good pop-up and spot/fire oppostunities in early battle.</p>
<h3>Destroyers</h3>
<p>B1: Stay back from the bush and move up only to fire, otherwise you can be spotted from the E2-D3 area. Get out sooner rather than later if the west side begins to fall.</p>
<p>B5: Out-tiered tankers can get good cover behind rocks and trees along the road.</p>
<p>H1: Small hill offes good cover, but it's a long shot to B1/C1.  Use this early then advance when enemy positions are known.</p>
<h3>Heavies</h3>
<p>Get up close and personal in the East or West lanes.</p>
<h3>SPG</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>On Fisherman's Bay, typically heavy tanks and a few mediums and TDs head to the village at the east, fighting along the 8 column with oppurtunities for supporting fire from further out east in D9 or F9-F10. The buildings here are mostly indestuctive, and allow for tanks who excel at urban combat to shine, though the long sniping ranges down the alley can counter reckless pushes. Flanks though the 7 column can be devasting, if somewhat risky. A few mediums or lights may patrol the center ridge and pop up for spotting or supporting fire to either flank. In particular, flanking fire towards D7-D8 or F7-F8 to counter flanks or a synchronized push from the center towards the sea down the E line are options.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rest of the mediums, TDs, and lights should go to the west. Support from the center in E4-F4 can also be useful, particularly from the north, but cannot convincingly win the flank. Fighting tends to be concentrated in the 1 column to the west of the raised road due to the cover it gives from flanking fire and the prevalance of rock cover in the depression. Many rocks are located here, large enough to totally conceal a tank, but spaced far enough away from each other that it is likely that enemy tanks will be able to get off a shot while you are moving from cover to cover. Very fast tanks may be able to get very close to the enemy lines by quickly heading down the west while the enemy is still moving into position, then hiding behind the rock and providing spotting for your own allies. Typical snipers reside in B1-B2 and A3 in the north and H1-H2 or J2-K2 in the south.</p>
<p>For both flanks, after defeating the first and second line enemies, continue to carefully progress north-south to eliminate any hiding snipers or SPGs, then sweep across laterally to or across the flag cap, but beware of enemy snipers in the other corner. Alternatively, heading to the middle allows you to support your allies pushing forward as well as supporting the other flank. Tight games on this map can be extremely entertaining to watch as teams react to spots, as long as the opponents do not insist in camping a corner.</p>
<p>The main pushes always occur on the east and/or west lanes.  One team will win a flank and push toward the enemy cap from that side.  So what’s the purpose of the middle?  You can’t push from the middle.  Even crossing the road exposes you to fire from many angles and many enemy tanks.  You can’t get much vision from the middle because both base areas have lots of camo cover.  The value in controlling the middle is being able to support and flank town.  From both sides the middle provides a number of good positions to fire from camo into lanes in town.</p>
