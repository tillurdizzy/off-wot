<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A rolling area, dominated by a couple of hills. The village of Redshire gives places to hide from hill to its northeast. Artillery will play a powerful role on this map. </p>
<p>Mediums are tasked with holding their respective hills and conquer the middle hill. </p>
<p>Heavies are meant to manage a breakthrough at the east flank, and rarely they might make a stand down in the southwest.</p>
<p>Light tanks can zip around the map semi-comfortably, especially near the middle hill.</p>
