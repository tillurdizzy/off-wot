<h2>Quick Strategy</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Mediums and Lights</h3>
<p>Lights and fast mediums can play more to the center of the map, and occasionally at the center buildings next to the river, but this is usually less effective.</p>
<h3>Destroyers</h3>
<p>Both sides feature a ridge that is an effective location for snipers. Northern TDs tend to favor east more, while the south is usually more evenly split.</p>
<h3>Heavies</h3>
<p>Typically the heavies split 50:50 or slightly more to the west.</p>
<h3>SPG</h3>
<p>Position either at the center or in one of the corner to better support an individual flank.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Generally the east side emphasizes gun depression, view-range/camo, and mobility, while the west requires armor and gun performance more. From the north, the west side is fairly easily won with an early, aggressive push if the team works together, while the same can be said for the south for the east, due to the fact that these pushes will deny sniping positions to the opposing team. However, more passive play favors the south in the west and north in the east due to the better sniping positions, though this doesn't mean that such an advantage can be defeated by a careful slow push later on.</p>
<p>The role of the center is somewhat dependent on the game mode. For both Standard and Assault, tanks in the center can take advantage of unaware tanks on either flank, but tend to be easily focused down when spotted. A light tank might be able to streak down the center while the flanks are occupied to destroy enemy artillery, but otherwise the center is mostly a supporting role. However, for Encounter, the capture circle is in the center of the map. Fast captures are not uncommon, especially at low and mid-tiers, so it is wise to send a tank or two to the middle early to stall and spot the cappers, or risk having to have tanks from the flank cross open-fields to stop the cap in a rush.</p>
