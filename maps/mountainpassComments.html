<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A large map with many turns and rough ground. The bridge near the center features natural choke points on both sides, and provides a good sniping position against opponents in the north passes if held. There are small positions for artillery near the bases, though artillery may have difficulty due to the terrain. </p>
