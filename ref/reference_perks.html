	<h4>What to get first?</h4>
	<p>Mentor is number 1 most recommended skill to get first. It helps your crew get more experience. It's roughly 10% extra (1% extra for every % it's worked on). Because it's a skill it functions at 1% efficiency at 1%, 25% at 25% so on. After completing Mentor,  all other skills/perks take 1/10th LESS experience to complete.</p>
	<p>Next, Situational Awareness, Sixth Sense, Camo, Recon.</p>
	<h4>Light Tanks</h4>
	<p>For all light tanks that you intend to actually scout with, the following crew skills recommended (in this order if you are grinding a crew from scratch): Mentor, Situational Awareness, Sixth Sense, Camo and Recon. After that, depending on the tank and how you drive should effect how you get the rest of your skills. Are you worried about crew members getting hit? Maybe think about getting Jack of All Trades... Catching fire while running? Firefighting and Preventative measures. Shoot on the run a lot? Smooth Ride and Snap Shot. Find those hard to get locations for scouting? Offroad driving.</p>
