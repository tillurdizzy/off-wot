<h4>Optics and Range</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Maximum detection range for ANY tank is 445 meters. Anything beyond 445 is only for cutting through camo factor.</li>
		<li>If you have 390 meters, coated optics raise it to about 429, then you can add Recon and Situational Awareness from your crew to raise it over the 445 meter mark.</li>
		<li>Recon helps cut through camo factor more than it increases view range (increase of about 5%-7%).</li>
		<li>Situational Awareness increases view range by about 5%, but doesn't go down for damaged optics. It also has a passive bonus of preserving some of your view range when optics are damaged. It doesn't help cut through camo any more than view range from any other source.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<label>View Range</label>
		<li>View Range is the theoretical maximum distance that your vehicle's Commander (not you!) can see, and depends on the vehicle's turret, the Commander's effective primary skill level, whether the Commander has the Recon skill and the Radio Operator has the Situational Awareness skill, as well as the usage of view range stat enhancing equipment like Coated Optics or Binoculars. View Range has no relevance of its own, its only purpose is to serve as a factor for calculating the spotting range.</li>
		<li>View range enhancing equipment does just that. It enhances view range up to a particular distance. If your view, without the equipment, already exceeds the equipment capability, your view range will not increase.</li>
		<li>Recon helps cut through camo factor more than it increases view range (increase of about 5%-7%).</li>
		<li>Situational Awareness increases view range by about 5%, but doesn't go down for damaged optics. It also has a passive bonus of preserving some of your view range when optics are damaged. It doesn't help cut through camo any more than view range from any other source.</li>
